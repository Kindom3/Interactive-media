Electricity is measured in volts (V) eg. 110v. there are two types, AC and DC, ac example is a wall plug with alternating current, dc example batteries, constant/direct voltage. Current (A) is measured in amps. Resistance (R) is the amount of current being reduced like slightly pinching a hose with flowing water.
Question: Can Ohm’s law be considered resistance.
Ohm’s law equates to V=IR
